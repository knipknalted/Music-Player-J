# Music Player J
A music player I'm making in rust as a personal project. Currently only works well/at all with aac encoding.  


# Goals
Make settings window nicer, maybe use Area instead of Window  
*Maybe* make the search bar cursor blink, and work with arrow keys(big maybe)  
Improve file type handling  



Done, but not tested extensively
--------------------------------
*Eventually* add persistent settings for stuff like directory path, etc  


Done
--------------------------------
Make the whole app window have a minimum size, not sure how to yet
Move the "NOW PLAYING" readout to the right side of the control bar  
Fix new search bar filter  
Try to get the song metadata reading to work so I can at least adjust the rendering of song card with metadata  
Adjust song card display, maybe align numbers closer to left and fixed distance
